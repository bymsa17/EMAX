# GEOMEX
**GEOMEX** is a platform 2D videogame. In this game you are a robot, which has been put in another world by a scientist through a portal. Your objective is to escape from this world by collecting the pieces of the portal distributed in the different levels, unlocking the path and avoiding the dark fog that haunts you. 

***

## Project Features

You will have to solve some simple puzzles with objects of the environment to be able to continue your way, using your special ability. 
The difficulty? The world which Dr. Matirius has created is not stable. The awful and darkest gloom lurks in this laboratory and our companion Gex.
To be able to return and report what happened, you must find a way out. Can you help him find the parts of the portal back without falling eclipsed by the black fog?

The ultimate goal of the game is to be able to build the portal that will take you back home. For this you must collect the different pieces of this that are distributed by the different levels of the game.
